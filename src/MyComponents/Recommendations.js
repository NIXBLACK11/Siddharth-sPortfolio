				<h3 className="small text-white py-2">I am grateful for the opportunity to have co-mentored Siddharth during his MLH fellowship with Meta AI. Over the course of the program, Siddharth established himself as a core contributor of the "laser_encoders" package (https://github.com/facebookresearch/LASER/tree/main/laser_encoders), and made significant contributions to the AI research community. One such contribution was the resolution of a hard-to-find and longstanding bug with an existing open-sourced and widely used Python library in ML research. Siddharth not only found the solution, but also quickly sent a pull request to the project, and landed it! It was a pleasure to work with Siddharth, and I'm hoping that our paths will cross again sometime in the near future!</h3>
